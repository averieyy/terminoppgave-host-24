# Plan

*How do one create a discord clone?*

The goal is to make a webpage app that has servers and channels for people to talk in.

## API ENDPOINTS

- Some way of connecting to a channel (to get live updates / messages)
- Sending messages
- Logging in / Registering

## WEB PAGES

- Login & Register
- Channel view
- Server listing
- About & FAQ
- Server moderation / Editing server settings

## DESICIONS

- Should DMs exist (be implemented)
- Invitation system for servers? Should all servers be public
